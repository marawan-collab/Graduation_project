# MRI Brain Tumor Detection Model Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The MRI analysis is failing because the trained model file is missing.

## Solution

You need to place a trained Keras model file named `mri_brain_tumor.h5` in the `model/` directory.

## Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: Download from Kaggle
1. Go to [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Search for "brain tumor detection" or "MRI brain tumor classification"
3. Look for datasets/notebooks that include trained models
4. Download the `.h5` model file
5. Place it in: `C:\xampp\htdocs\INFO\model\mri_brain_tumor.h5`

### Option 2: Use GitHub Repositories
Search GitHub for:
- "brain tumor detection keras"
- "MRI classification model"
- "medical imaging deep learning"

Example repositories often include:
- Pre-trained model files
- Model weights
- Training scripts

### Option 3: Train Your Own Model
If you have a brain tumor detection dataset, you can train a model using:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Example model architecture (adjust as needed)
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Train your model here...
model.save('model/mri_brain_tumor.h5')
```

## Model Requirements

The model must:
- Accept input shape: `(224, 224, 3)` for RGB images
- Output: Single value (0 to 1) for binary classification
- Format: Keras HDF5 (`.h5`) format
- Architecture: Compatible with TensorFlow/Keras

## Verify Setup

After placing the model file, test it:
```bash
python test_mri_model.py
```

Or upload an MRI image through the web interface.

## Expected File Structure

```
INFO/
├── model/
│   ├── mri_brain_tumor.h5  ← Required model file
│   └── README.md
├── mri_analysis.py
├── app.py
└── ...
```

## Troubleshooting

- **File not found error**: Ensure the file is named exactly `mri_brain_tumor.h5`
- **Model loading error**: Check that the model is compatible with your TensorFlow version
- **Analysis fails**: Verify the model accepts 224x224 RGB images
