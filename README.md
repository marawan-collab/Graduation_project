## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-docs.git
cd secure-docs
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=your-mysql-user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
MYSQL_DB=securedocs_db
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
python setup_db.py
```

6. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Security Measures

1. **File Security**
   - Files are encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode
   - Each file has a unique encryption key
   - File integrity is verified using SHA-256 hashing

2. **Authentication Security**
   - Secure session management
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - OAuth2 integration for social login
   - Two-factor authentication support

3. **Application Security**
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Secure headers implementation
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

## Usage

1. **User Registration/Login**
   - Register a new account or login with existing credentials
   - Option to use Google or GitHub for authentication
   - Enable two-factor authentication for additional security

2. **Document Management**
   - Upload documents through the secure interface
   - View and manage your documents
   - Download encrypted documents
   - Verify document integrity

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Monitor system activity
   - Manage users and roles
   - Review access logs
   - Handle document management
